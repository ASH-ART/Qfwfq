# Qfwfq

A sub-40% keyboard PCB in the spirit of [weteor's Klacker_BS](https://github.com/weteor/Klacker_BS), with base kit modifiers and MechVault-style split bars. It wouldn't be a sub-40% without spicy keycap compatibility.

## Status
WIP; awaiting layout feedback from testers.

## Specs
* Atmega 32U4-AU MCU (Why??)
* MX and Hi-Tek 725 (space invaders) switch footprints
* ESD and overcurrent protection
* Other stuff like diodes (not the cool ones)
* That symmetry and space invaders outline
* Cool palindromic name

## Todo
- [x] Confirm prototype works
- [x] BOM and CPL files
- [x] Firmware
- [x] Generic silk
- [ ] Misc. cleanups
- [ ] Use git submodule for parts lib
